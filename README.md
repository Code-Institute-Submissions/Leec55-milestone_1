# The Property Place

[View the live project here.](https://leec55.github.io/milestone_1/)

This is a full-fledge website for a property letting and management company. The website features ‘about us’, 'gallery', ‘contact form’ and ‘social media links’. The objective of this projects is to generate leads for the business through the contact page. 

As property letting can be a long and time consuming process, it can take time for new clients to make informed decisions about the agent they would like to act on their behalf. Therefore, the website aims to provide useful information, showcasing what the company has to offer , and sharing a gallery of properties that have been successfully let. A realistic project timeline is also communicated with users on the contact page to show various stages of the consultation process from the beginning to the completion of a project. 

The business goals of this website are:
* Increase business awareness.
* Reach wider clients by showcasing what the company has to offer.
* Generate leads (via the contact page).

The customer visit this website to:
* Search for a reliable and experienced property agent and manager to maximise their investment return. 
* Have enough compelling and convincing evidence that this agency is the right fit for their property portfolio. 
* Find the contact information effortlessly by filling up a form to speak to a company representative.  

### Ideal client 
The ideal client for this business is: 
* English speaking
* Values experience
* Home-owner or Investor 

The project help clients to: 
* navigate easily through the website and reach the information they need easily. 
* get to know the agency, what is has to offer, and to contact the agency directly. 

### User stories:

## Surface 
The company name and a menu bar are aligned to the left in the header incorporating black and white colours to represent a sleek and modern feel in keeping with the brand. This colour coordination is seen throughout the body of the website with dark typography to represent a minimalist yet bold styles. 

# Features 
### Header
The website consists of three pages; About Us, Gallery and Contact Us. The **header** contains a **menu** option on the top leftof every page.  This will create consistency throughout the page and the user can access the information via the menu bar and move around the site. The links will remain active when in use. 

### Footer
Every page has a **footer** with **social media icons** and **privacy** and **terms** .  
There is also a **Back to top** button which with one click it takes the user to the menu bar. 

### About Us
The About Us page features an **image of hands** to emphasize the strength of teamwork. To the left side of the image, there is some information about the agency to make the users feel connected to the company.  

### Gallery
The Gallery page features **images of properties** to give the user an understanding that the agency is focusing on the higher end market of luxury and high value properties.

# Existing Features 
* Header Company Name – Exists on every page aiming to promote brand awareness. Clicking on the logo will return the users to the Home page as they expect. 
* Header Navigation Bar – Exists on every page to allow users to navigate the website and move from one page to another for access to more information.

* Contact Page – Provides a contact form. It allows the clients to send their request for further information. 

# Features to Implement in future
Due to time restraints, I was unable to include the following features but hope to implement them in a future release:
* Embed up-to-date social media feeds - To showcase promotional activity and create buzz for the client base.
* Promotional video on the homepage – To make the homepage more appealing and engaging and create a more positive emotional response to the user. There was no promotional video available at this stage. 
* Agency’s blog to share articles and guides for added value. The agency has not had time to create a blog yet.  
* Live Chat app - To provide an instant connection between the user and company with high visibility on the site. I do not have the skills yet. 
* Add CAPTCHA to contact form – Allows business to protect the contact form from spam.  – JavaScript Needed.
* FAQ page, table with FAQs and dropdown buttons to view answers - Helps potential clients find answers to their common questions. (The company has to compile and provide a list in the future.)

# Technologies Used
